# Project LYR

This was a silly attempt to make some sort of a dating site. It was meant as a joke at first, so I didn't really finsih it.
It is pretty barebones though. Just consider it to be a simple concept idea, which was never fully implemented...

I do plan on forking this repository, and creating some sort of a guessing game where you will be given the name of something (celebrity, object, etc.) and you have to pick from the image on the right or the image on the left.
